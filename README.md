# PETAWAWA_PATHFINDER

**A Django-powered navigation tool for CFB Petawawa â€” by service members, for service members**

## Challenge  
New arrivals rely on word-of-mouth to find buildings, leading to wasted time, inefficiency, and confusion.

## Solution  
A web app that delivers building search, map-based directions, offline access, and up-to-date info via an admin panel.

## Core Features  
- **Search** by building number or name  
- **Smart suggestions** for typos/partial queries  
- **Map view** with step-by-step routing  
- **Building info** (unit, contacts, hours)  
- **Offline access** for low-connectivity use  
- **Admin panel** for secure updates
